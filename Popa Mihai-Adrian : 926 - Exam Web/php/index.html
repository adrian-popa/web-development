<!-- Write a web application for assigning grades to students for various courses. The application will have two types of users:
professors and students. A student can only display his own grades. Students are organized in groups. A professor can add or modify
a grade for the students in a group at a specific course. In order to retrieve the list of students from a group, the web application
will use AJAX. Prior to using the application the users (professors and students) must log in using a username and a password.
Students in a group should be displayed on pages with maximum 4 students on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page). -->
