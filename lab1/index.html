    <h2>It's spinning!</h2>
    <p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark
        matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek galaxias, literally "milky", a reference to
        the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one
        hundred trillion (1014) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>
    <p>Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Many
        galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central black hole,
        known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the
        oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and
        observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.</p>

    <h2>The gravity in things.</h2>
    <p>A planetary system is a set of gravitationally bound non-stellar objects in or out of orbit around a star or star
        system. Generally speaking, systems with one or more planets constitute a planetary system, although such
        systems may also consist of bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, natural satellites, meteoroids, comets,
        planetesimals and circumstellar disks. The Sun together with the planets revolving around it, including Earth,
        is known as the Solar System. The term exoplanetary system is sometimes used in reference to other planetary
        systems.</p>

                ), also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the
                Andromeda Nebula (see below), is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs)
                from Earth, and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way. The galaxy's name stems from the area of the
                Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda.
            </p>
            <p>The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1
                trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any
                accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin
                of some 25% to 50%. This has been called into question by a 2018 study which cited a lower estimate on the
                mass of the Andromeda Galaxy, combined with preliminary reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher mass
                of the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it the
                largest member of the Local Group at least in terms of extension, if not mass.</p>
            <p>The number of stars contained in the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated at one trillion (1×1012), or roughly twice
                the number estimated for the Milky Way.</p>
            <p>The Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in around 4.5 billion years, merging to form a
                giant elliptical galaxy or a large lenticular galaxy. With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the
                Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects making it visible to the naked eye from
                Earth on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.</p>
